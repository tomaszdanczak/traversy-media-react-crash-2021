## Stack
- React (useState, useEffect, defaultProps, propTypes, map, delete, add and update data in state)
- Axios (load data from DB, delete, add and update data in DB)
- localStorage (load data from localStorage, delete, add and update data in localStorage)
- JSON Server
- react-router-dom
- React-Icons
- Fetch

## Things I did myself
- In version hosted on Github I created logic of using localStorage
- In local version of the project I used axios instead Featch api
- I saved apiEndpoint in config.json file and use it from there
- I rebuilt functions (I think changes I did makes this functions more clearly)
- gh-pages (I used process.env.PUBLIC_URL)
